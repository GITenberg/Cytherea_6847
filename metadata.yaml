description: American socialite Lee Randon flees to Cuba to escape boredom amongst
  his loving family. The climax of his torrid romance with Savina Grove, also running
  away from her obligations, leads to self-realization and a new appreciation of his
  wife Fanny. This 1922 novel, scandalous for its time, showcases the author's eye
  for description of the wealthy and decadent.
